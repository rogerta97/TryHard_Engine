## Innovations:

- Interpolation when centering camera with 'F'
- A Skybox
- Possibility of changing the engine font
- Slightly advanced performance tools
- Scene in a dock

## How to use:

### Tools:

- Console: Shows and hides the console panel, the console LOGS the start LOGS and when you import geometry it shows the details of it.
- RandomNum: Shows and hides a random generator tool panel.
- Configuration: Shows the configuration panel where we can find a Menu Items with functionalities that apply to the scene or the engine workflow, it also shows the system information.
- Performance: Shows the init and  Start-up performance of the modules and the run time graphs of the modules with preupdate, update and post-update.
- Inspector: Shows information about the selected game object and offers some options like changing the texture.
- Hierarchy: Displays the game objects in the scene.

### Help:

- DEMO GUI: shows the original demo panel from ImGui.
- Documentation:opens the github repository page.  
- Report a bug:brings you to github issues.
- License:brings you to the MIT license about the github repository

### Camera movement:

- WASD: movement (forward,left,backwards,right.
- F: camera focuses the last mesh.
- R & F: move up and down the camera.
- Alt + left mouse click: camera orbits around selected game object with mouse movement.
- Mouse wheel: zoom in and out.
- Right Click: look in de direction of mouse movement.	
- Import .FBX files: Drag and drop into the scene.

## Warning
